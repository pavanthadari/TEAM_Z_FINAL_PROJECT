# AutoSDLC Architect Pro

---

üìö **Project Overview**

AutoSDLC Architect Pro is a web-based application designed to automate the majority of the Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC) phases using Generative AI technologies. By taking a natural language software idea from the user, the system generates functional requirements, non-functional requirements, system architecture, UML diagrams, prototype code snippets, and test cases ‚Äî all powered through local LLMs (via Ollama) for maximum privacy and control.

‚öôÔ∏è **Installation**

1. **Clone the Repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/AutoSDLC_Architect_Pro.git
   cd AutoSDLC_Architect_Pro
   ```

2. **Set Up Python Environment**
   ```bash
   python3 -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate   # On Windows use venv\Scripts\activate
   ```

3. **Install Requirements**
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. **Start Ollama (Local LLM Server)**
   > Ensure Ollama is installed and running. Models like `llama3`, `codellama`, or fine-tuned SDLC models are recommended.

5. **Run the App**
   ```bash
   python app.py
   ```

6. **Access the App**
   Open your browser and go to `http://localhost:5000/`

üìä **Percentage of Automation**

| Module | Description | Automation Percentage |
|:---|:---|:---|
| Requirements Agent | Functional and non-functional requirements generation | **95%** |
| Architecture Agent | System architecture design and description | **90%** |
| UML Agent | UML diagrams (Class, Sequence) | **85%** |
| Code Agent | Prototype code snippet generation | **80%** |
| Testcase Agent | Test case generation based on requirements | **85%** |
| Evaluator Agent | Aggregating and organizing outputs | **90%** |
| **Overall Automation** | End-to-end SDLC coverage based on user input | **~88%** |

> ‚ö° Note: Minor human fine-tuning might still be needed for large or complex projects.
